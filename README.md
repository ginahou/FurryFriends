Time: 4.5 hrs

Completed Milestones:

    Make a screen to move the Rabbit around
        Add the rabbit image with 4 buttons for left, right, up, and down.
        Add a button to hide the rabbit.
        Add a button to show the rabbit again.
        
    Feeding the rabbit
    
    Shrinking the rabbit
    
    Add animation to the scale, so the rabbit grows or shrinks smoothly
    
    Make the rabbit go to where you tapped. (My scrollView for the parallax was covering my field touch area, so I showed it in a separate GIF)
    
    Resetting the rabbit
    
    Rotating the rabbit
    
    Scroll Views
        Add parallax between the rabbit and the field.
    
    Login Screen
        Create a login screen. Add elements for the email field, password field, and login button. Configure the password field for secure entry.
        Create an action on login button. Call performSegueWithIdentifier on the login button.
        dd a delay after clicking the login button. Add a UIActivityIndicatorView.
        Check the email and password. If it's correct, segue. If it's incorrect, display a UIAlertView.
        Disable the login button if there is no text in either the login field or the password field.


To Dos:

      Add welcome screens with UIPageControl.
      
      Chatting with the rabbit
      
      Logout
